**Usage and Backstory**

I wanted a PS5 around June-July 2021 , and it was very difficult to grab one during the flash sale as the stock was limited and use to sold out within minutes and the sites use be slow due to high traffic. So I wrote the script for amazon , shopatsc , vijaysales and gametheshop and was able to grab it.
To make sure that it works successfully set up the drivers and packages path in python scripts and update the ps5 product page URLs as they change over time.
Fill up the details indicated by the commets in the script and make sure to test before your actual run.
